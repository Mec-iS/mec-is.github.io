    "2. Reach a written/unformal specification of the task, defining sequential sub-tasks or complementary functions to solve the problem\n",

    "4. Code\n",
    "5. Iterate with adjustments and tests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "1. write down a function name that realize a sub-task\n",
    "2. write the docstring for the function\n",
    "3. find the best built-in functions or libraries to realize the task in the function (forget optimization for now, try to be idiomatic and use the fittest tools)\n",
    "4. write different functions depending on your style (functional, object oriented)\n",
    "5. Accomplish the task by defining a \"main\" script that uses the functions\n",
