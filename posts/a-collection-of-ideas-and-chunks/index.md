This is a collection of all the interesting things I have found during my Python learning experience, collected in IPython notebooks. These are basically only annotations and code, not real blogposts, so it's up to you to read, take some partial knowledge and structure the content. Hope it is for pyCoders like a good dip made from mashed chickpeas... Yeah, I love hummus (:
